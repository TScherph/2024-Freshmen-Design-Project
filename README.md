# College-Arm-2023-present
This is a continuation of the robotic arm I created in highschool, however I found a partner and breifly a team that was willing to assist in the project and help with its development
In the spring of my freshmen year as a mechanical engineering student, 2024, I took a course called "Freshmen Design" where my section of the course was tasked with creating a medical device or invention that could be easily produced and created to help those who needed it. I was put into a group of 5 total members, and after some discussion we decided that we would create a modular prosthetic arm. 

Our projects goal was to, from scratch, develop a robotic arm that was capable of seperating into each of its important components, each self sufficient, and to be able to reassemble this in a multiutude of fashions, We argued that if a prosthesis using this design were developed, it would be advantagous as you could have different attachments for different purposes. A more rigid or solid hand or fingers for tasks like lifting heavy objects, but a more flexible and softer hand for more intricate tasks like holding glasses or reading a book. The beauty of our project was that the interchangability of these parts would all come down to 3 things. A simple 3d printed design with a magnetic clasp, an independant bluetooth microcontroller on each part, and compact simple wiring. 
We achieved this by using self made wire bundles, esp32 modules that were programmed to listen to a central controller located off of the arm, and a 3dprinted design of a clip and magnets.
