# College-Arm-2023-present
This is a continuation of the robotic arm I created in highschool, however I found a partner and breifly a team that was willing to assist in the project and help with its development
In the spring of my freshmen year as a mechanical engineering student, 2024, I took a 10 week course called "Freshmen Design" where my section of the course was tasked with creating a medical device or invention that could be easily produced and created to help those who needed it. I was put into a group of 5 total members, and after some discussion we decided that we would create a modular prosthetic arm. 

Our projects goal was to, from scratch, develop a robotic arm that was capable of seperating into each of its important components, each self sufficient, and to be able to reassemble this in a multiutude of fashions, We argued that if a prosthesis using this design were developed, it would be advantagous as you could have different attachments for different purposes. A more rigid or solid hand or fingers for tasks like lifting heavy objects, but a more flexible and softer hand for more intricate tasks like holding glasses or reading a book. The beauty of our project was that the interchangability of these parts would all come down to 3 things. A simple 3d printed design with a magnetic clasp, an independant bluetooth microcontroller on each part, and compact simple wiring. 
We achieved this by using self made wire bundles, esp32 modules that were programmed to listen to a central controller located off of the arm, and a 3dprinted design of a clip and magnets.

My role in this project was the CAD, rendering, and assembly of the arm. I assisted in the programming of some motor controlling and bluetooth, but the programming of the gyroscope and its calculations, along with the more effectient motor control was left to two other members. 

Throughout the 10 week course, though we had to present the finished project at the end of the 9th week, I went through 2 major designs both shown below.
